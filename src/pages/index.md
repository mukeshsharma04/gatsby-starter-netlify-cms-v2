    You’ve undertaken a project. Or you’re creating a product. Congratulations! The future looks bright. But your team is already loaded or isn’t fully trained in the required technologies. Maybe there simply is not enough bandwidth.<br />That's where Primoko comes in.<br />We can step in and quickly begin advising you on all architecture decisions, mapping out the pros and cons of various design decisions, and coding and implementing your vision. We’re not jacks of all trades here; we’re experts in a few. If those few are what you’re looking for, then you’ll be hard-pressed to find better engineers anywhere.

    We’re software engineers first. Yes, we do handle the sales, marketing, customer relations and other non-engineering functions, but everyone in the company comes from a technical background.<br />We're also elite, meaning we hire and grow the best talent and that makes us very good at what we do. We bring years of experience architecting large projects to the table and look forward to stepping in at whatever level you need us.
