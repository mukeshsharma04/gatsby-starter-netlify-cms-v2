        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    You’ve undertaken a project. Or you’re creating a product. Congratulations! The future looks bright. But your team is already loaded or isn’t fully trained in the required technologies. Maybe there simply is not enough bandwidth.<br />That's where Primoko comes in.<br />We can step in and quickly begin advising you on all architecture decisions, mapping out the pros and cons of various design decisions, and coding and implementing your vision. We’re not jacks of all trades here; we’re experts in a few. If those few are what you’re looking for, then you’ll be hard-pressed to find better engineers anywhere.
