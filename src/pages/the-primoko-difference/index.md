heading: Why Primoko? We speak geek.
description: >-
  If you search the web for "web development," "software development," or "app development," you’ll find millions of companies plying their wares.<br />We’re one of those millions, but here’s what makes us different.
list:
  - We’re all engineers. Seriously. Even our sales, marketing, and customer relations people started as engineers before branching out into other functions. This means we all speak geek.
  - When you work with us, you’ll speak with an engineer.
  - Your Technical Account Manager will not be a sales person or even a junior engineer. In most cases, your contact will be a senior engineer, senior enough to collaborate with your CTO. If you do not have a CTO, then we are happy to wear that hat and help you to craft technology that is in your best interest, advising you as if we were your CTO and not a third party.
  - If you need a high level of support, we will work as if we are part of your company, not a separate, outside vendor.
others: We like to chase the hard engineering problems, the kind that hold companies back.
